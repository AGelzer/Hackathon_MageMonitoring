MageMonitoring
==============

Magento Extension to get health of your Magento installation (Server, PHP, APC, Logs, Rewrites, Modules version installed ...)

### Features

The module gathers information of the current Magento installation:

- OS / Server / Memory Information / Magento version vs available
- PHP version and some important configuration values vs recommended
- Modules installed and their version number
- Cache statistics with option to flush each cache (APC, APCU, Memcache, ZendOpcache)
- Magento debug/exception logs
- Check for class and template file rewrites
- Custom site widgets can be added from other modules via observer

### Usage

Go to the menu System > Tools > Monitoring

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

### Via modman

- Install [modman](https://github.com/colinmollenhour/modman)
- Use the command from your Magento installation folder: `modman clone https://github.com/magento-hackathon/Hackathon_MageMonitoring/`

### Via composer
- Install [composer](http://getcomposer.org/download/)
- Install [Magento Composer](https://github.com/magento-hackathon/magento-composer-installer)
- Create a composer.json into your project like the following sample:

```json
{
    ...
    "require": {
        "magento-hackathon/hackathon_magemonitoring":"*"
    },
    "repositories": [
	    {
            "type": "composer",
            "url": "http://packages.firegento.com"
        }
    ],
    "extra":{
        "magento-root-dir": "./"
    }
}
```

- Then from your `composer.json` folder: `php composer.phar install` or `composer install`

### Manually
- You can copy the files from the folders of this repository to the same folders of your installation


### Installation in ALL CASES
* Clear the cache, logout from the admin panel and then login again.

Uninstallation
--------------
* Remove all extension files from your Magento installation
* Via modman: `modman remove Hackathon_MageMonitoring`
* Via composer, remove the line of your composer.json related to `magento-hackathon/hackathon_magemonitoring`

### How to add a new cache widget

- Clone develop branch
- Have a look at the interface class Hackathon_MageMonitoring_Model_Widget_CacheStat
- Implement the interface, extend from Hackathon_MageMonitoring_Model_Widget_CacheStat_Abstract to take care of boilerplate
- For extra values have a look at Hackathon_MageMonitoring_Model_Widget_CacheStat_Dummy::getOutput()
- Drop the class into Model/Widget/CacheStat
- You are done. Pull requests welcome. ;)

### How to add a custom widget from another module

- In your module add an observer that subscribes to magemonitoring_collect_widgets_cachestat/dashboard event.
  See config.xml of this module.
- Now follow the same procedure as for adding a new cache widget, exchange CacheStat with Dashboard as needed
- Drop the impl class into the folder your observer publishes.

### Status of Project

So a lot happened here in the dev branch, what changed:

- We now have generic widgets in place, the prev. CacheStats interface was bit to specific for other use cases.
 Check Widget interface in model folder.
- Other modules can subscribe their widgets to any tab in this module. (currently only dashboard/cachestat, but could be easily all tabs if we want)
 Good for site/module specific widgets.
- Widgets now have generic ajax refresh.
- Widgets that have a collapsed init state will not render their output until opened. Good for widgets that are resource heavy.
- Widgets support generic configuration mechanism for user interaction. Frontend users can edit default collapseable state per widget now.

Use case example:

You want to monitor a sql query specific to a magento site:

- Create new class in Model/Widget/Dashboard/Myquery.php thats extends from Widget_Abstract and implements Widget
- Implement getOutput(), getName(), getVersion(), isActive() see Dummy widgets for examples
- Done. :)

TODO:

- Refactor other tabs to use new widget interface where it makes sense? I would say logs and system overview tabs as those might be interesting targets for adding custom widgets.
- Support generic callback mechanism, ie widget adds a custom button and wants method x getting called when the user clicks on the button.
 Should be fairly easy to implement, just add generic callback handler to controller that calls passed methodname on the widget. Display simple result msg from called method, all via ajax. BONUSPOINTS: optional refresh of widget after call
- Javascript in widget.phtml and sub templates could use some refactoring, probably better to create generic functions that take the widgetId as parameter
- Change collapseable refresh/config icons to something that matches magento theme.
- Make icon display more dynamic, check the dummy widget on cache tab to see what i mean (space between refresh and close icon)
- Refresh icon should not display if widget is in collapsed state.
 The icon already gets a class 'widget-invis' added/removed when the collapsable gets toggled but does not work anymore with latest css changes.
- Check css/frontend for any further quirks
- Refactor monitoring controller, move ajax stuff into seperate AjaxController?
- Create some widgets for dashboard. =) A widget that displays certain edge checks would be nice.
 For example, shop had xx user registrations today, but only x placed an order.

NICETOHAVE:

- Magento Permissions per widget, generic if possible
- Magento Permissions per tab
- More config types for widget configuration, currently we only have text/checkbox. Magento date picker would be nice, select and radio too.
 (see widget/config.phtml as starting point)
- Use magento validation for generic input checking of config modal inputs

Just create an issue with the task if you want to do one of the above.
